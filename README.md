# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation was to have a webpage where I can see my notes and also see my prework lesson modules in real time as I prepared for class to begin.
- I built this Webpage to track my goals, notes, and accomplishments for KU Coding Bootcamp.
- The Webpage creates a convenient location to have easy access to my notes and accomplishments. 
- Building this webpage gave me a briend insight into what is to come in the months ahead and allowed me to ease into the work without being as overwhelmed. 
- The Webpage can also be viewed by others so that they may be able to also learn or overcome obstacles they may be stuck on; this is now another part of the coding community.

## Installation

## Usage

This webpage can be used to see some of the notes that I have had in regards to topics tha we briefly touched base on as an introduction to our bootcamp course. HTML, JavaScript, Git, and CSS are the four topics that we focused on.

If anyone would like to see the JavaScript running they need only to open the DevTools console.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
